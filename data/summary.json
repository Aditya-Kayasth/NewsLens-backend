            "description": "The Whiteside County Health Department has brought awareness to West Nile virus cases in Illinois that have already surpassed last year's total,as reported by KWQC. \"Illinois \u2026 has confirmed 79 cases so far this year, already exceeding last year's total by 10,\" said Whiteside County Health Department representative Cory Law. In Illinois, the West Nile virus, specifically, is mainly spread through the bite of an infected mosquito that has fed on an infected bird. While most people who contract the virus only experience mild flu-like symptoms, vulnerable populations such as people with chronic health conditions or weakened immune systems, or older adults, are at higher risk for severe illness. The Illinois resident who died of West Nile was in their 60s.",
